# MidiAndMusicXmlPlayer
MidiAndMusicXmlPlayer plays Midi files and MusicXML files. These are note files made by some Notation Program

The voices/instrument of a tune may be selected by checkmarks. The tempo and transposition may be changed. Also The voices/instruments may be changed (to a few other instruments).  

The panorama (move instrument from left to right) can be set. All this in order to better hear the single voices/instrument. Intended use is learning a tune, that you want to sing or play.

The compiled program can be downloaded from: http://www.programfabriken.com/MidiAndMusicXmlPlayerPc64.zip

Some MusicXML test files can be found at: https://wpmedia.musicxml.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/xmlsamples.zip
